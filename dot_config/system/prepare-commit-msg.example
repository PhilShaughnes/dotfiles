# An example hook script to prepare the commit log message.
# Called by "git commit" with the name of the file that has the
# commit message, followed by the description of the commit
# message's source.  The hook's purpose is to edit the commit
# message file.  If the hook fails with a non-zero status,
# the commit is aborted.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "prepare-commit-msg".

# This hook includes three examples. The first one removes the
# "# Please enter the commit message..." help message.
#
# The second includes the output of "git diff --name-status -r"
# into the message, just before the "git status" output.  It is
# commented because it doesn't cope with --amend or with squashed
# commits.
#
# The third example adds a Signed-off-by line to the message, that can
# still be edited.  This is rarely a good idea.

# This sets the jira number as the first part of the commit message
#
# first is gets the branch name, splits it by "-", then puts it back between the
# first two arguments ($1 and $2). That is set to the JIRA variable.
#
# then we get we add it the first line of the new commit message file, with a "#"
# before it so that it is a comment - this means that if you exit without changing
# anything it will cancel the commit b/c your message is empty. without the comment
# it does a commit with just your inserted jira number.
